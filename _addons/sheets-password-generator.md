This is an add-on for Google Sheets to quickly generate kid-friendly passwords inspired by [DinoPass](https://dinopass.com/) by [Codemoji](https://www.codemoji.com/). To use it, make a copy of the [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWk81tkkH7XN9D62qiD8QZ0tG1P6G8BGDmfCuzuXryY/copy) and follow the tutorial below. If you'd like to customize the way the passwords are generated, see "Customizing the passwords" in this [blog post](http://localhost:4000/post/2019/05/19/generate-passwords-in-google-sheets/#customizing-the-passwords).

## A word of caution
I've done my best to make sure the word combinations and numbers are school appropriate kid-friendly. However, once your passwords are generated, I'd recommend double checking them before giving them to students. If you notice any problematic combinations, [let me know]({% link _pages/contact.md %}) and I'll revise the code.
