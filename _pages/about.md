I am a Digital Learning Teacher at Plympton Elementary School in Waltham, MA. When people refer to me, they use the pronouns "he", "him", and "his." I work with students and teachers to incorporate digital literacy and computer science standards and skills into lessons and projects. I'm interested in working with classroom teachers and coaches to find ways to incorporate these skills and standards into existing curricula.

I'm a graduate of Brandeis University where I studied education and computer science. I combined these areas in my honors thesis, for which I created an [inline trainer plugin]({% link _projects/moodle-inline-trainer.md %}) for Moodle to help instructors learn how to use its various features.

When I'm not in school, I enjoy writing code (check out some of my projects below), reading books, and running.
