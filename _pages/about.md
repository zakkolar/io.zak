I am a recent graduate of Brandeis University, where I earned a bachelor’s degree in Education Studies and Computer Science. I’ve always had a passion for technology and wanted to combine that with my interest in education. In schools, there is a gap between accessing and implementing technology. I’d like to fill that gap. Teachers don’t always have time to research and test apps and devices. This can make for a frustrating experience for them and their students. It is important that both teachers and students have the support they need, and I would like to provide that support.

When I’m not doing school work or programming, I can generally be found working on lights in the theater.
