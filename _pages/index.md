## Welcome!

My name is Zak Kolar. I'm a digital learning teacher at Plympton Elementary School in Waltham, Massachusetts. I work with students and teachers to incorporate technology, digital literacy, and computer science into classes. On this website, you'll find information about me, projects I've worked on, and blog posts with tech tips, tutorials, and more.
