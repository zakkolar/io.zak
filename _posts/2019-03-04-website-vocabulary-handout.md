As part of a project where students create websites, I made a handout that labels common parts of web pages (title, header, navigation menu, main content, and footer) and some additional website vocabulary (website, home page, hyperlink, URL).

The top has a diagram of a website with the title, navigation menu, header, main content, and footer labeled. The bottom defines the terms website, home page, hyperlinks, and URL">

The handout is available as a [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cSK7uHOm0yLPUBfLmaVdPEEUoJshqUSL/view?usp=sharing) as well as a [Google Drawing](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Esh-NIwJYAs0B9XIGuBStO-EF_IVk773cGahYOn-VSw). If you'd like to modify the Google Drawing, you should make a copy first.
