As part of a project where students create websites, I made a handout that labels common parts of web pages (title, header, navigation menu, main content, and footer) and some additional website vocabulary (website, home page, hyperlink, URL).

The top has a diagram of a website with the title, navigation menu, header, main content, and footer labeled. The bottom defines the terms website, home page, hyperlinks, and URL">

The handout is available as a [PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GC0SOsbGPMJEJvAjl8gbRhRiC4acDGIK) as well as a [Google Drawing](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AX4xj_imQwSp-6nFkOewDJzVfc8RGWFtEpsGuUCocEA). If you'd like to modify the Google Drawing, you should make a copy first.

Feel free to use and modify this as you see fit - all I ask is that you give me credit and use a compatible license if you decide to share your modifications.
