With the end of the school year coming up and distance learning continuing through the end, we've been looking for ways to continue traditions virtually. One tradition for our 5th graders is creating a T shirt with each student's signature. To help with this, I created an Apps Script template for Google Slides to collect signatures from a distance.

![Screensnot of a Google Slide filled with handwritten signatures](/assets/images/posts/2020-05-18-collect-signatures-in-google-slides/signatures.png){: style="max-width:400px;"}

## Add-on

The add-on creates a web page you can send to students. The page has a form for students to type and sign their names on a computer or mobile device. All of the signatures are saved into a Google Slide, where they can be resized, rotated, and arranged as desired. Once the layout is done, you can download the slide with all of the signatures as a PNG with a transparent file to use for a yearbook page, T shirt, or any other project that uses signatures. To see how it works and how to set it up, watch the video below.



## Set up

Make a copy of this [template](https://go.zak.io/signatures){: target="_blank"} to get started (click the blue "Use Template" button in the top right corner). Once you've read the instructions, you can delete them from the slide. You'll need to resize the slide to whatever dimensions you want your final image to be. Then, watch the following video to see how to publish the submission page in the Apps Script editor (less than 5 minutes). Once you set this up, send the link to students to start collecting signatures!

Good luck with your signature project!
